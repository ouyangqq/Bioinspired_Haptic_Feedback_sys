# model_tactile_pop_response

This is the code for the paper "Bio-inspired Haptic Feedback for Artificial Palpation in Robotic Surgery"
 
The source code of current model was presented in the function "population_simulate()" in file of receptor.py, which correctly implements the diagram as illustrated in Fig. 1 in the paper. All the simulation results in the paper were obtained by calling this funtion. You can run the code directly on your computer (>=Python3.6, with Numpy, matplotlib and scipy library)
